CredQ has an edge over others through its data-driven AI approach that underwrites risk by using alternative data points & psychometric testing that translates into a predicted credit score and loan amount that the borrower is qualified for and could successfully repay. CredQ enables its financial partners to assess borrower's 
“ability and willingness” to repay, mitigate their risk, reduce default rate and more loan approvals.`
